# Cats-Dogs-Classification
This is my first Deep Learning project in which I built and trained a convolution neural network for classifying images of Cats and Dogs using Python Keras.

# Dataset
I worked on a dataset from kaggle, here is the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog) if you want to download it directly.
